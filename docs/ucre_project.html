            <h2>Summary</h2>
            <p>In this project, we were trying to learn more about how we would increase the experience for Kelly
                Strayhorn Theater, a local performance theater located in Pittsburgh. We were given with little
                requirements, and we were intended to define a problem space and an area of improvement ourselves.
                We conducted background research and performed several interviews to learn more about the potential pain
                points for people and for small performance theaters. Based on the insights, we identified an area of
                improvement, and proposed a solution with iterations of prototype. Our final prototype design was about
                having a tiny online theater experience where people can chat among the audience.
            </p>

        <div>
            <h2>Problem</h2>
            <h4 style = "padding-bottom: 20px;">The audience felt they are less connected when watching a show online. They missed the in person theater
                experience, and they don't think having a mere chat box is sufficient to replace the experience.

                    <p>We first started to learn more about our clients with several background analysis. Based on the data provided by the client and information we found online, we preliminarily think that the business model of a local theater is different from that of a larger scale. We would need to focus more on the pain points on this community theater.

                        We asked participants to share what they think while walking through the tasks we designed. 
                          From these interviews, we found that participants were confused about the website design, 
                          and they often don't appreciate the visuals on the social media account managed by the theater. </p>

            <h2>Insights</h2>
            <p>1. People care about online engagement with eath others the most. They were eager to communicate with others in a better way than merely chat box.</p>
            <p>2. Physical souvenirs received a lot of love from people. People usually keep them for a long time, and having these souvenirs presented would remind people the good time they spent.</p>
            <p>3. Advertisement for an community theater was not a main point of concern from people. When people decide to go to the local theater, their main reasoning were not from the advertisements.</p>
            <p>4. People don't think there is a strong need to completely change the online viewing experience. If there is a director in the back of the livestream operating the cameras, they are the experts and their choices should be appreciated.</p>

            <h2>Solution - Online tiny theater</h2>
            <p>Based on our previous findings, our group propose a improved platform in the virtual space that helped increasing the audience engagement, both within the audience group, and with the performers. We performed two iterations of the concept, and we finalize the experience to a seamless online theater experience.</p>
            <img src = "assets/image/projectimg/KST/KST Solution.png" style = "max-width: 100%;">
            <h3>Key features</h3>
            <p>Users can join in a virtual theater place to select an avatar of their own choices. They could interact and walk arround in the virtual theater.</p>
            <p>Users can react with quick emojis after the performance started. This is to mimick the clapping or smiling sound in the in-person theater.</p>
            <p>When the performaners enable interactive mode, users can type and sing along with the performer. This creates a sense of connection both with the performers and the rest of the audience.</p>

            <h5><i>"Being able to see comments is great...But in a real in-person show, you don’t get to hear what everyone is thinking. That would be too distracting for the viewers. Usually just the laughs, the claps are enough." - participant's feedback on our first iteration of concept
            </i></h5><br>
            <h5><i>"Being able to move around virtually during the performance makes it so much more interesting!"
